**Tips**:

* where no parallel data is available, use unsupervised NMT techniques.
* A solution is to synthetically generate data, which is called data augmentation

- if the available parallel corpora is small, it is possible to combine them with the monolingual data of the languages concerned, in a semi-supervised manner.
